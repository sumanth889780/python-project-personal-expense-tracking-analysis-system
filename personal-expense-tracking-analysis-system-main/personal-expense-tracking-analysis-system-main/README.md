# Personal Expense Tracking and Analysis System

A Python Flask web application for recording personal income and expenses,
setting monthly budgets, checking savings, viewing charts, and downloading
reports. It is an academic project for personal expense management.

## Main features

- Add, edit, search, filter, and delete income and expense records.
- Add income and expense categories.
- Create monthly category budgets and compare a budget with actual spending.
- View total income, total expenses, savings, and budget status on the dashboard.
- Select a date, month, or year to view records and charts for that period.
- Generate expense category, income-versus-expense, savings, and budget charts.
- Download transaction data as CSV and generate reports.

## Tools used

| Tool | Where it is used |
| --- | --- |
| Python | Main programming language for the application. |
| Flask | Creates routes, handles forms, and runs the web application. |
| Jinja2 | Shows database data inside HTML pages. |
| HTML and CSS | Builds the page layout, forms, buttons, and responsive design. |
| SQLAlchemy | Connects Python code with database tables safely. |
| MySQL / TiDB Cloud | Stores transactions, categories, and monthly budgets. |
| SQLite | Local database option for testing on a computer. |
| Matplotlib | Creates pie, bar, and line charts on the server. |
| Pandas and NumPy | Helps calculate totals, trends, and spending analysis. |
| Flask-Migrate / Alembic | Manages database table changes. |
| PyMySQL | Lets Flask connect to MySQL-compatible databases. |
| Visual Studio Code | Used to write, organise, and run the project code. |
| Git and GitHub | Used for version control and publishing the project source. |
| Vercel | Used to deploy the Flask project with a public link. |

## Project structure

- `app.py` — starts the Flask application in VS Code.
- `database.py` — checks the database connection.
- `app/__init__.py` — creates and configures the Flask app.
- `app/models.py` — defines database tables.
- `app/routes/web.py` — dashboard, forms, budgets, reports, and delete actions.
- `app/routes/api.py` — JSON API endpoints.
- `app/services/charts.py` — creates Matplotlib charts.
- `schema.sql` — MySQL tables and sample records.
- `requirements.txt` — required Python packages.

## Run locally in VS Code

Open this project folder in VS Code. Run the following commands in the PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Database setup

For local testing, the project uses SQLite automatically.

For MySQL or TiDB Cloud, create a `.env` file and add your private database
connection string and secret key. Never upload `.env` to GitHub.

```text
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-private-secret
```

Create tables with:

```powershell
python manage.py init-db
```

You can also use `schema.sql` in a MySQL client to create the tables and sample data.

## Deployment

The project contains `api/index.py` and `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment.
In Vercel, add `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` as environment variables before
deploying. A hosted MySQL-compatible database is required because a Vercel
function does not keep local SQLite data permanently.

## API endpoints

The project includes health, dashboard, transaction, category, budget, monthly
analytics, category analytics, budget analytics, and CSV export API endpoints.
See [API documentation](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for details.
